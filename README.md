Inspired by theller's template https://github.com/thheller/next-cljs

This is a great project to explore clojure's datacentric approach against nextjs's file based routing. 
The way it works, cljs lays in generating the static files and nextjs serves them.


Minimal example showing how shadow-cljs could be used together with next.js to create static sites in CLJS.

`nextjs` is a directory used by `next`, all `.js` files will be generated by shadow-cljs.

## Run shadow-cljs

```
npm install
npx shadow-cljs watch nextjs
# or
npx shadow-cljs release nextjs
```

## Run next separately

```
cd site
npm install
npx next
# or
npx next build && npx next start
```

## When done open in browser

```
open http://localhost:3000
```
